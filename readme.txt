What Is This?

This mod adds frozen ice planes over the top of lakes and ponds in-game.

It does not do this automatically - you must go into the DayZ Editor and set some of this up yourself. It takes time - it took me about 2 hours to do all of Livonia (I'll include my Winter Livonia config below).

Once an "ice plane" is spawned over a lake, players cannot fish, drink or collect water from that lake UNLESS they cut a hole in it using a pickaxe or iceaxe.

Here is a video showing how it works in-game:

And here is a video guide for server admins who want to set this up for a different map (Winter Livonia config is included by default, but no other maps currently have a default config):

If you set this up on a different map to Winter Livonia, please share your config here in the Discussions for other server admins if you feel so inclined - it would be greatly appreciated!

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod must be installed on both server and client.

When you run the mod for the first time a config file will automatically be created in %server_profiles/Zenarchist/ZenIceLakes.c

This is where you set up the ice lake spawns. There is a full guide on my wiki and youtube channel: https://github.com/ZenarchistCode/ZenModPack/wiki/Ice-Lakes

It's pretty simple to set up but does take a fair bit of time to cover every lake on a map (Winter Livonia took me around 2-3 hours to do alone).

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.io

Buy Me A Coffee:

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
